# Cls12_Hotel_management_system
Project using Python and MySQL connector
I had developed this project to present as my final evaluation in my plus 2.
This project features room booking , bill generation , tax management , customer entries insertion, updation and deletion.
Unfortunately, i wasn't knowing HTML/CSS that time ,so my frontend was Python Terminal  but it was fully functional ;)
